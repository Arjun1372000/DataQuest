# DataQuest2 Hackathon
Ayurvedic Herb Traceability System 
*(Theme: Heritage & Culture)* 
## Problem Statement: 
The supply chain for Ayurvedic herbs is often unclear and fragmented. This 
lack of transparency makes it difficult to verify the purity and origin of herbs, 
leading to issues like a lack of trust, fake products, and quality concerns. 
Consumers cannot be sure if the medicine they are taking contains the 
correct, high-quality ingredients, which undermines the effectiveness of the 
treatment and harms the credibility of the entire industry. 

## How to Solve: 
### Digital Tagging:
Create a unique digital ID for each batch of herbs at the farm 
level, perhaps using a QR code or barcode.   

### Track the Journey:
As the herbs move from the farm to processing, packaging, 
and the store, each step is recorded in the digital system.  

### Build a Secure Database:
Store all this tracking information in a secure, 
tamper-proof database (like a blockchain) to ensure the data cannot be 
changed or faked. 

### Create a User App:
Build a simple app for consumers. By scanning the QR 
code on the product, they can see a timeline of where the herbs came from 
and their journey.   

### Onboard Partners:
Partner with farmers, processors, and Ayurvedic 
companies to get them to use the system and record their data.
